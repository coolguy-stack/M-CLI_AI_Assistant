# M-CLI_AI_Assistant

Built an OpenAI API integrated custom chatbot on my very own CLI that helps me deal with various inquiries I may have locally or on Visual Studio Code while I am working.
Very simple to get started on your own. Simply go on your preferred IDE and creat a .env file. Declare your API key from OpenAI as a variable named API_KEY. 
On the command terminal then, create a package.json file by running npm int -y. Make sure to have all the Node dependancies downloaded first. From there, add the script.js file I made and run.
